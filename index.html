    <p>My name is Kismet, AKA, Eden B. I am a 24-year-old 2D Artist 
        aspiring to get into game and web development in addition to my current career 
        of being in IT. I hope to get into the animation and game development industry.</p>

    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in <b>Baltimore, MD</b> and went to college for Computer Science. 
        I've been a character artist of 15-16 years, and now I'm trying to turn my career 
        around to pursue my passion: <strong>Animation/Illustration, storytelling, and game development.</strong>
